- **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 30 days

### Security Measures

This project implements several security measures:

#### Environment Variables
- All sensitive configuration data uses environment variables
- No hardcoded API keys or passwords in source code
- `.env.example` template provided for secure setup

#### Input Validation
- All external API responses are validated
- User inputs are sanitized
- SQL injection protection through parameterized queries

#### Access Control
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- Authentication required for sensitive operations
- Non-root container execution

#### Data Protection
- Database connections use encryption where possible
- API keys are stored securely
- Audit logging for sensitive operations

### Security Best Practices

When using this software:

1. **Environment Setup**
   - Use strong passwords for database access
   - Rotate API keys regularly
   - Keep environment variables secure

2. **Network Security**
   - Use HTTPS in production
   - Implement proper firewall rules
   - Consider VPN for remote access

3. **Updates**
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Monitor security advisories
   - Apply security patches promptly

4. **Monitoring**
   - Review logs regularly
   - Set up alerts for suspicious activity
   - Monitor resource usage

### Known Security Considerations

#### API Keys
- This software requires multiple third-party API keys
- Ensure API keys have minimal required permissions
- Monitor API usage for anomalies

#### Financial Data
- This software handles financial market data
- Ensure compliance with relevant regulations
- Implement appropriate data retention policies

#### Network Exposure
- Dashboard and monitoring interfaces should be properly secured
- Consider using reverse proxy with authentication
- Limit access to trusted networks

### Vulnerability Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. **Private Disclosure**: Vulnerabilities are initially disclosed privately
2. **Coordinated Release**: Public disclosure coordinated with fix release
3. **Credit**: Security researchers are credited (unless they prefer anonymity)
4. **Timeline**: Reasonable time provided for users to update

### Security Audit

This project undergoes regular security reviews:

- **Automated Scanning**: GitHub security scanning enabled
- **Dependency Checking**: Regular dependency vulnerability scans
- **Code Review**: Security-focused code reviews for critical changes
